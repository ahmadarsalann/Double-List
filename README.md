# Playlist-Manager

The program idea belongs to my professor Ian Finalayson

DataStructure Used:
Linked List

The program is about managing a playlist of songs. A playlist is simply a list of songs — for this assignment it will be implemented as a doubly linked list. Each song contains two pieces of information: the title and the artist who performs it; each will be stored as strings.

The program supports the following features:

Add a song to the playlist.
Remove a song from the playlist.
Print the number of songs in the playlist.
“Play” the playlist. For our purposes, this will mean just printing out the songs from first to last.
Shuffle the list. You can do this any way you want so long as the list changes each time, and doesn’t change the exact same way. The shuffling should not be easily predictable.
Reverse the order of the playlist.
Save the playlist to a text file.
Load a previously saved playlist from a text file.
Quit.
